# Blackie Portfolio

This is the code for my personal portfolio site, rebuilt using React and other modern web technologies.

## About

I redesigned and rebuilt my portfolio site using:

- **React:** For creating the overall site and functionality
- **Sanity.io:** A backend CMS for managing portfolio content
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and layout
- **Framer Motion:** For page transitions and animations

The goal was to create a fast, modular, and editable portfolio site to showcase my latest projects and experience as a developer.

## Usage

The Sanity.io CMS allows easy management of portfolio content. New projects, bios, social profiles, and other info can be added and updated right from the Sanity dashboard.

React pulls this data and constructs the portfolio pages with custom components. Tailwind CSS handles styling the components cleanly and simply.

Framer Motion adds nice transitions and animations between routes and page elements.

Together this stack provides a smooth, animated, and completely customizable portfolio.

## Running Locally

To run this site locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a Sanity.io account and dataset, update the Sanity client config
4. Run `npm run start`
5. Edit content on Sanity, view updates locally in real-time

Let me know if any issues getting it running!
